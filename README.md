## System Design

The system is made up of five classes
* `Item`
  - Item instances represent products to be sold in the marketplace.
  - new Items take a code, a name and a price.
  - In lieu of a database, items are currently stored in an array held as a class variable `catalogue`.


* `PromotionalRule`
  - PromotionalRule is responsible for creating new sales and calculating discounts.
  - PromotionalRule takes two classes as initialization arguments, and has methods to instantiate these classes into the system.
  - `PercentageDiscount` is responsible for checking if a figure is above a specified threshold, and returning a specified percentage to be deducted if so.
  - Only one PercentageDiscount instance can be active in the system.
  - `MultibuyDiscount` is responsible for checking an order to see if a particular item has a certain number of purchases, and returning an amount to be deducted if so.
  - Multiple MultibuyDiscount instances may be active in the system.
  - PromotionalRule will then combine all discount figures into a final figure.


* `Checkout`
 - Checkout is the public interface to the system.
 - Checkout is instantiated taking instances of Item and PromotionalRule as arguments.
 - Checkout will store scanned items, and upon the `total` method being called, pass the total cost and current order to PromotionalRule for discounts to be calculated.
